# band-dropbox-api-client

API Client for Band Archive on Dropbox.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies (for example with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)): `uv sync`.
2. Launch the terminal UI: `uv run python -m src.app`.
   - Optional: change the splash title by editing `src/resources/application.conf`.

The application opens with a short loading screen and then reveals the two-panel layout that will host the Dropbox browser in future iterations.
